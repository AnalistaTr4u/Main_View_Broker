						<h3 class="modal-title page-header text-uppercase">Anti-Money Laundering (AML)<br>Policy Compliance and Supervisory Procedures</h3>
					</div>

					<div class="modal-body text-justify">

						<h3 class="text-center text-uppercase">1. Company’s Policy</h3>
							<p>&emsp;It is the Policy of the Company to prohibit and actively prevent money laundering and any activity that facilitates money laundering or the funding of terrorist or criminal activities. Money laundering is generally defined as engaging in acts designed to conceal or disguise the true origins of criminally derived proceeds so that the unlawful proceeds appear to have derived from legitimate origins or constitute legitimate assets. Generally, money laundering occurs in three stages. Cash first enters the financial system at the "placement" stage, where the cash generated from criminal activities is converted into monetary instruments, such as money orders or traveler's checks, or deposited into accounts at financial institutions. At the "layering" stage, the funds are transferred or moved into other accounts or other financial institutions to further separate the money from its criminal origin. At the "integration" stage, the funds are reintroduced into the economy and used to purchase legitimate assets or to fund other criminal activities or legitimate businesses. Terrorist financing may not involve the proceeds of criminal conduct, but rather an attempt to conceal the origin or intended use of the funds, which will be used later for criminal purposes. All employees of Brand are required to receive a copy of the Company’s AML policy and are required to follow such policy and procedures. If an employee is caught violating any portion of the Company’s AML policies and procedures, a meeting with the AML Compliance Officer will occur, with the employee given written warning of such violation. If the employee violates the AML policies and procedures for the second time, immediate termination will occur.</p>

						<h3 class="text-center text-uppercase">2. AML Compliance Officer Designation and Duties</h3>
							<p>&emsp;The Company designates its Anti-Money Laundering Program Compliance Officer, with full responsibility for the Company’s AML program. The duties of the AML Compliance Officer will include monitoring the Company’s AML compliance, overseeing communication and training for employees. The AML Compliance Officer will also ensure that proper AML records are kept.</p>

						<h3 class="text-center text-uppercase">3. Giving AML Information to Law Enforcement Agencies and Other<br>Financial Institutions</h3>
							<p>&emsp;We will respond to Law Agencies and Other Financial Institutions or transactions by reporting the identity of the specified individual or organization, the account number, all identifying information provided by the account holder when the account was established, and the date and type of transaction.</p>
							<p>&emsp;We will share information about those suspected of terrorism and money laundering with other financial institutions for the purposes of identifying and reporting involve terrorist acts or money laundering activities.</p>

						<h3 class="text-center text-uppercase">4. Customer Identification and Verification</h3>
							<p>&emsp;We will, at a minimum: verify, to the extent reasonable and practicable, the identity of any client seeking to open an account; maintain records of information used to verify a client's identity; and check that a client does not appear on government terrorist lists. The kinds of information that we will collect before opening different types of accounts are listed below.</p>
							<p>&emsp;Brand provides the identification on the basis of the date of the actual documents containing information that identify the client, the client's representative.</p>
							<p>&emsp;If the organization is based on the identification documents issued by state authorities of foreign states, such documents should be legalized in the established order.</p>
							<p>&emsp;In the case of submission of the client copies of the documents the Company has the right to require the submission of original documents for review.</p>
							<p>&emsp;High Risk and Non-Cooperative Jurisdictions We will especially s c r u t i n i z e accounts that are located in problematic countries. Check the lists: USA, Iran, Cuba, Sudan, Syria, North Korea.</p>
							<p>&emsp;The FATF’ International Cooperation Review Group prepares a list of non-cooperative countries and territories. FATF’s primary role is to set global AML standards and ensure the effective implementation of these standards in all jurisdictions. Enhanced global compliance with the standards reduces money laundering risks to the international financial system, and increases transparency and effective international cooperation. In addition to the FATF's evaluation programs and follow-up processes, the FATF uses additional mechanisms to identify and to respond to jurisdictions with strategic deficiencies in their AML regimes that pose a risk to the international financial system and impede efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.</p>

						<h3 class="text-center text-uppercase">Customers Who Refuse To Provide Information</h3>
							<p>&emsp;If a potential or existing client either refuses to provide the information described above when requested, or appears to have intentionally provided misleading information, our Company will not open a new account and, after considering the risks involved, consider closing any existing account. The Company will also refuse any account which is determined to be “high risk” by the compliance officer.</p>
							<p>&emsp;Whether or not to accept an account from a high-risk business is determined on a case-by-case basis after taking into account all the facts and circumstances of each case. For example, Brand will evaluate such criteria such as the size of the account being opened, and ATI’s familiarity with the client. If a high-risk business account is opened, it will be monitored closely on an on-going basis to determine if any unusual cash movement or trading activity is occurring.</p>

						<h3 class="text-center text-uppercase">Verifying Information</h3>
							<p>&emsp;Based on the risk, and to the extent reasonable and practicable, we will ensure that we have a reasonable belief that we know the true identity of our clients by using risk-based procedures to verify and document the accuracy of the information we get about our clients. In verifying client identity, we will analyze any logical inconsistencies in the information we obtain.</p>
							<p>&emsp;We will verify client identity through documentary evidence, non-documentary evidence, or both. We will use documents to verify customer identity when appropriate documents are available. In light of the increased instances of identity fraud, we will supplement the use of documentary evidence by using the non-documentary means described below whenever possible. We may also use such non- documentary means, after using documentary evidence, if we are still uncertain about whether we know the true identity of the customer. We will provide notice to the customer that we are requesting additional information to verify the customer’s identity. We will not open a client account if we cannot form a reasonable belief of the client’s true identity. If the client’s identity cannot be proven, a SAR will be filed if warranted by the compliance officer.</p>
							<p>&emsp;Appropriate documents for verifying the identity of natural persons include the following: An unexpired driver’s license, passport, or other government identification showing nationality, residence, and photograph or other biometric safeguard, an unexpired alien registration card or other government issued identification showing nationality, residence and photograph or other biometric safeguard.</p>

						<h3 class="text-center text-uppercase">5. Supervisory Procedures for Opening Accounts</h3>
							<p>&emsp;Internal control - activities Brand, to identify transactions subject to mandatory control, and other operations with money or other property related to the legalization (laundering) of proceeds from crime and terrorist financing.</p>
							<p>&emsp;The main objective of internal control: prevent the engagement of Brand in the implementation of the legalization (laundering) of proceeds from crime and terrorist financing.</p>
							<p>&emsp;Measures aimed at countering the legalization (laundering) of proceeds from crime and terrorist financing:<br>
								&emsp;&mdash; Organization and implementation of internal control;<br>
								&emsp;&mdash; Obligatory control;<br>
								&emsp;&mdash; A ban on informing clients and other persons on measures taken against legalization (laundering) of proceeds from crime and terrorist financing, with the exception of informing customers about the suspension of the operations of refusal in carrying out the client's instructions on carrying out operations, to refuse to conclude a contract of bank account (deposit), the need to provide documents on the grounds stipulated by the present Federal Law;<br>
								&emsp;&mdash; Other measures to be taken in accordance with federal laws.
							</p>

						<h3 class="text-center text-uppercase">6. Monitoring Accounts For Suspicious Activity</h3>
							<p>&emsp;We will manually monitor a sufficient amount of account activity to permit identification of patterns of unusual size, volume, pattern or type of transactions, geographic factors such as whether jurisdictions designated as “non cooperative” are involved, or any of the “red flags” identified below. We will look at transactions, including deposits and wire transfers, in the context of other account activity to determine if a transaction lacks financial sense or is suspicious because it is an unusual transaction for that customer. The AML Compliance Officer or his or her designee will be responsible for this monitoring, will document when and how it is carried out, and will report suspicious activities to the appropriate authorities. Among the information we will use to determine whether to file a SAR are exception reports that include transaction size, location, type, number, and nature of the activity.</p>
							<p>&emsp;Red flags that signal possible money laundering or terrorist financing include, but are not limited to:</p>

							</p>

							<p>&emsp;When a member of the firm detects any red flag he or she will investigate further under the direction of the AML Compliance Officer. This may include gathering additional information internally or from third party sources, contacting the government, freezing the account, and filing a SAR.</p>

						<h3 class="text-center text-uppercase">7. Program to Test AML Program</h3>
							<p>&emsp;The firm will hire an independent, qualified party to provide an annual independent audit of our AML policies and procedures, and the compliance with said procedures. The firm will perform written follow-up to insure that any deficiencies noted during its annual review are addressed and corrected.</p>
							<p>&emsp;The Company will confirm with its AML audit firm that their audit program includes the following:</p>
							<p class="item">
								<span class="point">&emsp;1.</span>Audit objectives and scope of the exam;<br>
								<span class="point">&emsp;2.</span>Any recommendations on improving the AML program;<br>
								<span class="point">&emsp;3.</span>A discussion of any noted deficiencies and an action plan to be implemented by management to address these deficiencies;<br>
								<span class="point">&emsp;4.</span>An overall opinion of the adequacy of the Company’s AML program
							</p>
							<p>&emsp;A report of the independent review shall be addressed to senior management with a copy being maintained by the firm’s AML Compliance Officer.</p>

						<h3 class="text-center text-uppercase">8. Monitoring Employees, Employee Conduct, and Accounts</h3>
							<p>&emsp;The Company’s compliance officer will conduct a background check, including a check of any criminal records, on all new employees hired by the firm. Any suspicious or questionable background information will be discussed with the Company’s managing director prior to making any final employment decision.</p>
							<p>&emsp;If employees have trading accounts, we will subject employee accounts to the same AML procedures as client accounts, under the supervision of the AML Compliance Officer.</p>

						<h3 class="text-center text-uppercase">9. Confidential Reporting of AML Non-Compliance</h3>
							<p>&emsp;Employees will report any violations of the Company’s AML compliance program to the AML Compliance Officer, unless the violations implicate the Compliance Officer, in which case the employee shall report to other firm principals. Such reports will be confidential, and the employee will suffer no retaliation for making them.</p>
